# 01_DESIGN.md - Design & UI/UX Rules

## 1. Visual Style
- **Aesthetic**: Clean, modern, and minimalist, with a focus on clarity and usability.
- **Color Palette**: Adhere to the defined color palette in `tailwind.config.js`.
- **Typography**: Use the defined font sizes and weights from the design system.

## 2. Component Design
- **Atomic Design**: Components should be designed using atomic design principles (atoms, molecules, organisms, templates, pages).
- **Statefulness**: Components should be as stateless as possible, with state managed by hooks or a state management library.
- **Props**: Components should have a clear and consistent API, with well-defined props and default values.

## 3. User Experience
- **Responsiveness**: All components and pages should be fully responsive and tested on a range of devices.
- **Accessibility**: All components and pages should be accessible to users with disabilities, following WCAG 2.1 AA guidelines.
- **Performance**: All components and pages should be optimized for performance, with a focus on fast load times and smooth animations.
