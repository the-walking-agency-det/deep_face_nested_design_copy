# Testing Environment Blocker

## Summary
This document outlines a critical issue with the development environment that is preventing the execution of tests for the "Import Tracks and Metadata" feature. While the feature implementation and the corresponding tests have been fully coded, they could not be verified due to this blocker.

## The Problem
The `vitest` test runner, a core development dependency specified in `package.json`, is not being installed correctly. The `npm install` command completes without error, but it fails to create the necessary executable binary in the `node_modules/.bin` directory. This prevents the test suite from being run.

## Debugging Steps Taken
Several attempts were made to resolve this issue:
1.  **Direct Execution (`npx vitest`):** This failed because `npx` used a cached, isolated version of `vitest` that did not have access to the project's `jsdom` dependency.
2.  **NPM Script (`npm test`):** This failed with a `vitest: not found` error, indicating a `PATH` or installation issue.
3.  **Direct Path Execution (`./node_modules/.bin/vitest`):** This also failed with a `not found` error. A subsequent check revealed that the `vitest` binary was indeed missing from the `.bin` directory.
4.  **Re-installation (`npm install`):** A fresh `npm install` was run, but it did not resolve the issue. The `vitest` binary was still missing.
5.  **Clean Slate Installation:** An attempt was made to completely remove `node_modules` and `package-lock.json` to perform a clean installation. This failed due to a sandbox limitation that prevents the deletion of a large number of files.

## Current Status
- The code for the "Import Tracks and Metadata" feature is complete.
- Unit and component tests for the new feature have been written.
- These tests **have not been run** due to the environment issue.

## Recommendation
The feature is being submitted in an unverified state. It is highly recommended that the environment issue be resolved and the tests be run before this code is merged or deployed. The tests can be found in:
- `src/store/importStore.test.ts`
- `src/pages/ImportPage.test.tsx`
- `src/utils/backend.test.ts` (updated)
